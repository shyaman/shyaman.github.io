    description: Next-Generation Sequencing(NGS) methods like Illumina have made it
      possible to sequence DNAs with high throughput at an affordable cost. The
      total DNA of Eukaryotic is consists of the chloroplast, mitochondrial and
      nuclear reads. Though many works have used chloroplast data, the remaining
      mitochondrial and nuclear data have been left untouched. Thus we aimed to
      utilize mitochondrial and nuclear data to identify species-level
      differences among Strobilanthes species and to verify the results using
      the chloroplast assemblies.
