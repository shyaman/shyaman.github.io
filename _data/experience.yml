    description: Next-Generation Sequencing(NGS) methods like Illumina have made it
      possible to sequence DNAs with high throughput at an affordable cost. The
      total DNA of Eukaryotic is consists of the chloroplast, mitochondrial and
      nuclear reads. Though many works have used chloroplast data, the remaining
      mitochondrial and nuclear data have been left untouched. Thus we aimed to
      utilize mitochondrial and nuclear data to identify species-level
      differences among cinnamon species.

    description: Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) is a novel framework introduced by
      the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) for describing mental
      illness. Since it is a fairly recent introduction, existing biomedical
      literature needs to be classified by RDoC for it to be effective.
      Considering that manual annotation of articles is highly
      resource-consuming, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing
      techniques can be used to ease and automate this task. Therefore we
      employed those techniques to develop models for information retrieval and
      sentence extraction with RDoC.
