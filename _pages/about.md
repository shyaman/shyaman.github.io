I am an enthusiastic computer engineering undergarduate who is driven by a passion towards the fast evolving domains of computer science and engineering. 
I have an interest in developing embedded systems and also passionate about the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
Apart from that, I spend my leisure time capturing the moments in life through visual story, giving people a chance to see the way I am looking at the world with my desire and skill for photography.
